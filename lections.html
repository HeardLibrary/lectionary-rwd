							6:3 And one called to another and said: &#39;Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.&#39;

							6:4 The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke.

							6:5 And I said: &#39;Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!&#39;

							6:6 Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.

							6:7 The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: &#39;Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out.&#39;

							29:7 The voice of the LORD flashes forth flames of fire.

							3:5 Jesus answered, &#39;Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit.

							3:6 What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.

							3:7 Do not be astonished that I said to you, &#39;You must be born from above.&#39;

							3:8 The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.&#39;

							3:12 If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?

							3:13 No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.

							3:14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,

							3:15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
