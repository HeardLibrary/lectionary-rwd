					<br>
					5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, "Look, we are your bone and flesh.
					<br>
					<br>
					5:2 For some time, while Saul was king over us, it was you who led out Israel and brought it in. The LORD said to you: It is you who shall be shepherd of my people Israel, you who shall be ruler over Israel."
					<br>
					<br>
					5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.
					<br>
					<br>
					5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.<br>
					<br>
					5:5 At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
					<br>
					<br>
					5:9 David occupied the stronghold, and named it the city of David. David built the city all around from the Millo inward.
					<br>
					<br>
					5:10 And David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him.

					<br>
					48:1 Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God. His holy mountain,
					<br>
					<br>
					48:2 beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King.
					<br>
					<br>
					48:3 Within its citadels God has shown himself a sure defense.
					<br>
					<br>
					48:4 Then the kings assembled, they came on together.<br>
					<br>
					48:5 As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic, they took to flight;
					<br>
					<br>
					48:6 trembling took hold of them there, pains as of a woman in labor,
					<br>
					<br>
					48:7 as when an east wind shatters the ships of Tarshish.
					<br>
					<br>
					48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God establishes forever. Selah
					<br>
					<br>
					48:9 We ponder your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple.
					<br>
					<br>
					48:10 Your name, O God, like your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with victory.
					<br>
					<br>
					48:11 Let Mount Zion be glad, let the towns of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.
					<br>
					<br>
					48:12 Walk about Zion, go all around it, count its towers,
					<br>
					<br>
					48:13 consider well its ramparts; go through its citadels, that you may tell the next generation
					<br>
					<br>
					48:14 that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will be our guide forever.

					<br>
					2:1 He said to me: O mortal, stand up on your feet, and I will speak with you.
					<br>
					<br>
					2:2 And when he spoke to me, a spirit entered into me and set me on my feet; and I heard him speaking to me.
					<br>
					<br>
					2:3 He said to me, Mortal, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this very day.
					<br>
					<br>
					2:4 The descendants are impudent and stubborn. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, "Thus says the Lord GOD."
					<br>
					<br>
					2:5 Whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house), they shall know that there has been a prophet among them.

					<br>
					123:1 To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens!
					<br>
					<br>
					123:2 As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, until he has mercy upon us.
					<br>
					<br>
					123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us, for we have had more than enough of contempt.
					<br>
					<br>
					123:4 Our soul has had more than its fill of the scorn of those who are at ease, of the contempt of the proud.

					<br>
					12:2 I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows.
					<br>
					<br>
					12:3 And I know that such a person--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows--
					<br>
					<br>
					12:4 was caught up into Paradise and heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to repeat.
					<br>
					<br>
					12:5 On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.
					<br>
					<br>
					12:6 But if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard from me,
					<br>
					<br>
					12:7 even considering the exceptional character of the revelations. Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated.
					<br>
					<br>
					12:8 Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me,
					<br>
					<br>
					12:9 but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
					<br>
					<br>
					12:10 Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.

					<br>
					6:1 He left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:2 On the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astounded. They said, "Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands!
					<br>
					<br>
					6:3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:4 Then Jesus said to them, "Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house."
					<br>
					<br>
					6:5 And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:6 And he was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went about among the villages teaching.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:7 He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:8 He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts;
					<br>
					<br>
					6:9 but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:10 He said to them, "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:11 If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them."
					<br>
					<br>
					6:12 So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent.
					<br>
					<br>
					6:13 They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.
